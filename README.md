# cpp-learning-personal
We didn't had any C++ course at the ENSIM so i made a very tiny project to learn the basis. This project aims to reinforce the fundamentals of the C++ language, emphasizing the differences from Java as i was already familiar with it.

## Mini Projects

### Project 1: FirstProject

This mini-project puts into practice the use of basic variables and loops in C++. It's especialy oriented to learn the differences between C++ and Java. Such as variables declaration, like strings, how to make print statements in C++ and a basic use of the vector type.

### Project 2: Classes, Operator Overloading, and Complex Variables

The second mini-project explores the creation of classes, operator overloading, and the use of more complex variables. It highlights key differences between C++ and Java in these areas. Classes uses a cpp and h file as recommended in the rules of good use of C++ and follows its syntax guidelines.

## Installation

The project was created with Visual Studio Code by selecting the "empty project" option.

## Structure

The project is structured using 2 Visual Studio Code solutions.
